# socialize-backend

This is the backend for my final year project.

This Project is a very basic form of GraphQL-API made with NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB ( mongoose )

# Prerequisites for  this project

1, .env file, containing all the required environment variables imported in secrets.js file.


# Important

1, Although this is a GraphQL-API, it contains REST-API code ( LEGACY ).

2, To gmail in Nodemailer, you'll have to set up google cloud platform ( OAuth2). ( you can remove it from project or adjust accordingly )
